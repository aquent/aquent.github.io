## Introduction

Howdy, folks. You've found this resource, which means you're likely interested about Aquent's style guide and pattern library. This is a living document, which means it is subject to change and revision while we strive to improve the design and user experience of the Aquent website.

Things to note:
1. We use the Foundation Sites framework for our SASS/CSS and some of our interactivity.
2. Foundation relies on jQuery, and so do we.
