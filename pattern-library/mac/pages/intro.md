# Introduction

Welcome to MyAquent Client's (MAC) pattern library. This is a living, breathing resource that contains guidance on the style and use of MAC's visual assets. It is a tool as well as a guide to retain consistency, reusability, and a single source of truth among our product team's lexicon of code and UI elements.  



### Designers

Our product team uses Sketch as our primary tool for user interface design. Download our [Sketch Library](file:///C:/my_file.pdf) to access MAC's shared library of component symbols symbols.

### Developers
