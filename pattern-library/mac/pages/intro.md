# Introduction

Welcome to MyAquent Client's (MAC) pattern library. This is a living, breathing resource that contains guidance on the style and use of MAC's visual assets. It is as much a tool as it is a map to help us retain consistency, reusability, and a single source of truth among our product team's lexicon of code and UI elements.  



### Designers

Our product team uses Sketch as our primary tool for user interface design. Download the [MAC Sketch Library](file:///C:/my_file.pdf) to access this pattern library's symbols and shared components library.

### Developers

Insert a blurb for the product team developers â€“ what they use, to start in MAC and any accompanying link in Git, Codpen, or other to get started.
